Issue #3752 has been updated by Aaron Patterson.

Status changed from Assigned to Rejected

If you pass a wrong pointer to a function, it will segv just like the C
code would segv.  DL is not meant to protect you from errors you could
also make in C.

Here is an example of doing a null check, but with a crash.  Provide a
good file to taglib, and it won't crash.

    require 'dl'
        require 'dl/import'

            module Foo
                  extend DL::Importer
                        dlload '/opt/local/lib/libtag_c.dylib'
                              extern 'void* taglib_file_tag(void*)'
                                    extern 'void* taglib_file_new(char*)'
                                        end

                                            taglib_file =
                                            Foo.taglib_file_new(ARGV[0] ||
                                            'foo')

                                                if taglib_file.null?
                                                      puts "bad file"
                                                            Foo.taglib_file_tag(taglib_file)
                                                            # This will SEGV
                                                            # because it's a
                                                            NULL pointer
                                                                else
                                                                      file_tag
                                                                      =
                                                                      Foo.taglib_file_tag(taglib_file)
                                                                          end
